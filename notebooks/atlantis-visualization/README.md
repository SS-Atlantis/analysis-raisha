The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are made by
Raisha Lovindeer for sharing of Python code techniques
and notes.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ## [SSAM-compare-runs.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/atlantis-visualization/SSAM-compare-runs.ipynb)  
    
    Code scripts in R for comparing output of the Salish Sea Atlantis Model simulations using the [ReactiveAtlantis](https://github.com/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/ReactiveAtlantis) library. Output is displayed in a shiny app web browser.

* ## [SSAM-food-web.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/atlantis-visualization/SSAM-food-web.ipynb)  
    
    Code scripts in R for examining food web dynamics (including predation, recruitment, and growth of primary producers) from an output file of a Salish Sea Atlantis Model simulation using the [ReactiveAtlantis](https://github.com/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/ReactiveAtlantis) library. Output for each cell is displayed in a new shiny app web browser.

* ## [SSAM-hydrodynamics.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/atlantis-visualization/SSAM-hydrodynamics.ipynb)  
    
    Code scripts in R for exploring hydrodynamic forcing files (vertical transport, salinity and temperature) required for forcing the Salish Sea Atlantis Model. Code uses the [shinyrAtlantis](https://github.com/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/shinyrAtlantis) library. Output for each cell is displayed in a shiny app web browser.
