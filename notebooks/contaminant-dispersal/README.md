* ## [SSAM-box-oil-anime.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/contaminant-dispersal/SSAM-box-oil-anime.ipynb)  
    
    Animating oil dispersion on the Salish Sea Atlantis grid. Original code written by Bec Gordon & Javier Porobic, CSIRO, modified to create an animated GIF

* ## [SSAM-parcels.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/contaminant-dispersal/SSAM-parcels.ipynb)  
    
    Using [Ocean Parcels](https://oceanparcels.org) to track the surface movement of contaminants. 
    Original code written by Bec Gordon & Javier Porobic, CSIRO, and code requires additional python libraries stored in /Parcel_Utils/ within the [SSAM Ocean Parcels Repo](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/users/por07g/repos/ssam_oceanparcels/browse)

* ## [Spill_Scenarios.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/contaminant-dispersal/Spill_Scenarios.ipynb)  
    
    **Salish Sea Oil Spill Scenarios**
    
    This notebook describes oil particle tracking for spills scenarios in the Salish Sea developed in conjunction with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). The code if for translating particle tracking from *ocean parcels* using the *Salish Sea Cast* grid into input forcing files for *Atlantis* for the *Atlantis* box grid.

* ## [SSAM-parse-tracks.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SS-Atlantis/analysis-raisha/blob/main/contaminant-dispersal/SSAM-parse-tracks.ipynb)  
    
    Mapping particle tracks from Ocean Parcels unto the Salish Sea Atlantis Boxes. 
    Original code written by Bec Gordon & Javier Porobic, CSIRO.
